# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

This Repository has Jupyter and CSV Files for performing the basic EDA on the datasets, learning the correct process, and finding the conclusion from the dataset.
